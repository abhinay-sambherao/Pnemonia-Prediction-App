```markdown
# 🩺 Pneumonia Prediction Web App

A web-based application that predicts pneumonia from chest X-ray images using state-of-the-art deep learning models. Designed to assist healthcare professionals and patients with early and accurate detection of pneumonia.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 Upload chest X-ray images for instant analysis
- 🤖 Multiple trained CNN models for high accuracy
- 💡 Real-time predictions with detailed output
- 🧼 Clean and responsive web interface (HTML/CSS/JS)
- 🛠️ Built using Python, Flask, and modern frontend technologies

## 📦 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pneumonia-prediction-app.git
cd pneumonia-prediction-app
```

2. **Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r current_requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the app**

```bash
python app.py
```

5. **Access in browser**

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Upload a chest X-ray image (JPG/PNG).
2. The image is processed through one or more CNN models (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
3. The model predicts whether pneumonia is present.
4. The result is displayed with additional analysis/visuals if available.

## ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- NumPy, OpenCV, Pillow
- See `current_requirements.txt` for full list

---

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure the model files are placed inside the `models/` directory.
- You can swap or add models as needed — just update the loading code in `app.py`.
- This is a research/educational tool and should not replace medical diagnosis.
